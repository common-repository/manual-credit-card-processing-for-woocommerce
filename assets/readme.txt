# Manual Credit Card Processing for WooCommerce

Manual Credit Card Processing for WooCommerce adds the ability to increase your sources of revenue.
Our Manual Credit Card Processing for WooCommerce extension allows you and/or your service representatives to start taking payments fast and securely through the WordPress / WooCommerce system.

Manual Credit Card Processing for WooCommerce will not effect your websites PCI Compliance and SAQ process. We take advantage of the existing payment gateways and shipping extensions that your website uses already, adding no extra risk. The forms and options available are provided by the currently activated plugins. We have found a way to tap into them for your convenience!

This plugin offers a handful of neat tricks under its shell, making phone orders possible and easier than ever. There are other plugins that perform the same tasks, but can be a hassle trying to get setup properly, stumble upon unwanted side effects or just don’t have a “Easy to Use” interface. This causes the PICNIC effect, making you wish you spent your money elsewhere. *cough*
